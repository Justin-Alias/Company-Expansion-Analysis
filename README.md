## Project Description
As a data scientist at a laundry-pickup services startup, my role extends beyond mere number-crunching; it's about leveraging data-driven insights to drive growth and competitiveness in a highly dynamic market landscape. Despite being a relatively small player compared to industry giants, our company boasts a strong presence in 140 locations, with recent expansions into 10 new cities.

The objective of this project is twofold: firstly, to identify which of the two sales regions is performing better based on key metrics including average revenue per city, average marketing spend per city (where lower is preferable), and average ROMI (return on marketing investment) per city (calculated as revenue divided by marketing spending). This analysis will provide valuable insights into the relative performance of each region and inform strategic decision-making to optimize resource allocation and drive revenue growth.

Furthermore, the project aims to identify which of the 10 new locations holds the greatest potential for the company to invest more funds into marketing. By analyzing various factors such as demographic profiles, market size, and competitive landscape, we will pinpoint the new locations with the highest growth potential and recommend targeted marketing strategies to maximize their impact.

Through a combination of data analysis, statistical modeling, and strategic insights, this project seeks to empower our company with the knowledge and foresight needed to navigate the complexities of the market, capitalize on emerging opportunities, and establish a strong foothold in the competitive landscape of laundry-pickup services.

### Complete the following tasks:
Identify which of the two sales regions is performing better based on the following metrics.
 - Average revenue per city
 - Average marketing spend per city (less is better)
 - Average ROMI (return on marketing investment) per city (revenue/marketing spending)

Idenitfy which of the 10 new locations have the best potential for the comapny to invest more funds into marketing.
